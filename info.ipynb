    "\n",
    "**Hypotheses for Identifying Potential Fake Accounts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Profiles with a minimal follower count are often fraudulent.\n",
    "- Usernames featuring a higher ratio of numerical digits to alphabetic characters are likely indicative of inauthentic accounts.\n",
    "- An absence of biographical information may suggest a profile is not genuine.\n",
    "- Biographies containing offensive language could be a marker of fake accounts.\n",
    "- The lack of a profile picture might signal an account's lack of authenticity.\n",
    "- Accounts that follow a large number of users, yet have few followers themselves, can be suspected of being fake.\n",
    "- A disproportionately high number of posts relative to the account's follower count could indicate inauthenticity.\n",
